1. Install uv from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv (follow their instructions).
2. In your project directory, run:

   uv pip install -r requirements.txt

This will automatically install all required libraries for your project, including GPIO and image processing dependencies.

Note: On Raspberry Pi, you may need to enable the pigpio daemon for gpiozero to work:

   sudo systemctl start pigpiod
   sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
